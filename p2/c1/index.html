		<h1>Checkpoint 1</h1>
		<h2>Company 1: The Global Pantry</h2>
		<p>Problem It Solves: Wanting to cook a specific international dish but having to buy large, expensive quantities of niche ingredients you'll only use once.</p>
		<p>What It Would Sell: A curated international grocery store organized by recipe. Instead of aisles for countries, you'd find a section for "Pad Thai" with small, recipe-sized portions of fish sauce, tamarind paste, and rice noodles. Another section might have everything for "Paella." It would sell pre-packaged, perfectly portioned meal kits from around the world, taking the intimidation and waste out of exploring global cuisine. </p>
		<h2>Company 2: The Hobby Hatchery</h2>
		<p>Problem It Solves: The high cost of entry for new hobbies. You want to learn to play the guitar, use a 3D printer, or start oil painting, but the initial investment in gear is huge, and you might not stick with it.</p>
		<p>What It Would Sell: A "library" for hobby equipment. You can rent a high-quality sewing machine, a professional camera lens, or a full set of woodworking tools for a week or a month. The shop would also sell curated "starter kits" and host introductory workshops. It's a try-before-you-buy model for skills.</p>
		<h2>Company 3: The Sensory Lab</h2>
		<p>Problem It Solves: In a world filled with digital noise and screen fatigue, it solves the problem of finding genuine calm and focus. It helps people combat daily stress and burnout by providing the tools to take back control of their personal environment.</p>
		<p>What It Would Sell: A curated wellness brand offering tools to create a personal sanctuary. It sells a thoughtful collection of products designed to engage the senses of scent, sound, and touch. Items include artisanal aromatherapy with essential oil diffusers, ambient sound machines for focus and sleep, and tactile comfort goods like weighted blankets and meditation cushions.</p>
